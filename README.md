# B.R.A.Y.N.S.

[Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/), [Restify](http://mcavage.github.io/node-restify/), [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/), [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/), [Node](http://nodejs.org/), and [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/).

This is my basic configuration that I use for new projects.
It's built for Node, and was built with Yeoman.
It uses Restify instead of Express (because Express is bloated, and Restify is incredible).
It comes with AngularJS and Stylus for making awesome interfaces, and Bootstrap so that everything looks good from the very beginning.
