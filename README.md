# Brayns
A generator for Yeoman for [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/), [Restify](http://mcavage.github.io/node-restify/), [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/), [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/), [Node](http://nodejs.org/), and [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/).

It's built to run on Node and be used through Yeoman.
It uses Restify instead of Express (because Express is bloated, and Restify is incredible).
It comes with AngularJS and Stylus for making awesome interfaces, and Bootstrap so that everything looks good from the very beginning.
If you don't want to be bloated by Bootstrap and jQuery, you can tell this Yeoman generator and it will give you a basic skeleton for your website (written in Stylus).

## Getting started
